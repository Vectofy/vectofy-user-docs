# Installation
<Warning>As the software is currently in an early limited release, the installation process is slightly more in-depth than it will be in the full release.</Warning>

A general overview of the software is given in this section. This includes requirements, as well as specific installation processes for different envorironments. If you run into any issues, then please contact us [here](info@vectofy.co.uk).

## Requirements
* **Operating System** - Currently, the software only runs reliably on Windows 10 and above
* **Excel Version** - Any version of Office 365

## Options for Installation
The software has two possible installation processes:
* [Individual](/installation/individual) - suitable if only you wish to use the software
* [Organisation](/installation/organisation) - suitable if your organisation has Office 365, you wish to distribute the software to multiple users, and you have access to the organisations Office 365 admin panel
If you are unsure which to choose, it's probably safe to get started with [individual](/installation/individual).
