# Individual Installation

This is the installation process for installing the software individually onto a single machine.

<Warning>
    This software is still in development, meaning the installation process for the full release will be simpler.
</Warning>

1. Create a new folder in your C: drive named 'Manifest'
2. Add the 'manifest.xml' file provided to you into the folder
3. Whilst within the 'Manifest' folder, right click, go to the 'Share with' option, and select 'Specific people...'
    - Sometimes, the 'Share with' option will show as 'Give access to'
4. Select your user from the list and press 'Share'
5. A new window will pop up saying 'Your folder is shared'. Take note of the URL below the 'Manifest' folder - it should read something like '\\Computer-Name\Manifest'
6. Open Excel, and go to File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings... > Trusted Add-in Catalogs
7. Add the URL noted from 5. into the 'Catalog Url' text input, and select 'Add catalog'. A new entry will appear in the 'Trusted Catalogs Table' - ensure that the 'Show in Menu' box is ticked for this
