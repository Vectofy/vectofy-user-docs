# Welcome to Vectofy

Vectofy is a Microsoft Excel add-in that uses 3D visualisations to help your productivity when working with complex Workbooks.

Vectofy helps with the macro and the micro, with the ability to view whole Workbooks, delve deep into complex formula, or quickly identify cells that aren't doing what they're supposed to.

If you are new here, then we recommend the following pages to help you get started:
- [Installation](/installation/installation): Instructions of how to install the software
- [Quickstart](/quickstart): A lightweight introduction to effectively using the software

<Warning>The software is still currently in the development stage with a limited release to a select few organisations and individuals. This means that processes such as distribution and installation, as well as features, are subject to change in the full release.</Warning>
