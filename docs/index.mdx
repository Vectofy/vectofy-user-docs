# Welcome to Vectofy

Vectofy is a Microsoft Excel add-in that uses 3D visualisations to help your productivity when working with complex Workbooks.

Vectofy helps with the macro and the micro, with the ability to view whole Workbooks or to delve deep into complex formula.

The software is still currently in the development stage with a limited release to a select few organisations and indivuals. This means that processes such as distribution and installation, as well as features, are subject to change in the full release.

If you are new here, then we recommend the following pages to help you get started:
- [Installation](/installation/installation): Instructions of how to install the software
- [Quickstart](/quickstart): A lightweight introduction of how to effectively use the software
