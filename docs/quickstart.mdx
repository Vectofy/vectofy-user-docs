# Quickstart

If you want to quickly get to grips with the main features of the software, then this quickstart is the right place to be. This will take less than 5 minutes. It will give you an overview of everything you need to get started.

Each section covers a main feature of the software:
1. Overview
2. Trace
3. Search
4. Refresh

## Overview

The overview section houses features that apply accross the whole workbook, and can be accessed from the toolbar or by using the shortcut `Alt + Shift + o`.

The main feature here is **Trace All Connections**. When pressed, all range-to-range formula connections will be shown as gradient lines on the visualisation, going from orange for precedents, to blue for dependents.

The exception log is also housed here. This is a list of errors that have occured during exection, although it is rare that any exceptions caught will cause the program to function incorrectly. If something does go wrong, check the exception log and send it across to info@vectofy.co.uk if possible._createMdxContent

## Trace

The trace section allows users to trace the dependents and precedents of a workbook. This can be accessed from the toolbar or by using the shortcut `Alt + Shift + t` whilst a single cell or range is selected.

The trace window is split into three synchronised sections:

1. **The visualisation**, which shows which cells are selected, along with their dependents and precedents and connections between them.
2. **The formula unpacker**, which shows the formula of the selected cell with substitued formulas for expanded precedents.
3. **The navigation pane**, which shows the selected cell and its precedents and dependents in a list. If an item has children, for example if a precedent has its own precedents, then the item can be expaned to show them. 

Doing this updates the visualisation to show the expanded children, and if a precedent is expanded then it's formula is subtituted into its reference in the formula unpacker.

## Search

The search section allows users to search for cells in the workbook. This can be accessed from the toolbar or by using the shortcut `Alt + Shift + s`.

The search window is also split into three synchronised sections:
1. **The visualisation**, which shows all cells that meet the search criteria
2. **The navigation pane**, which allows users to go through the search results in a categorised list, with cells able to be found by goin to the specfic error, then sheet, then cell.
3. **The search library**, situated at the bottom of the screen, which controls the search criteria. Simply tick searches for them to appear in the navigation pane and visualisation. A filter is also found here, allowing users to truncate the search results to the `x` amount that have the highest value for the specific filter, such as total precedents.

## Refresh

When Vectofy is loaded for the first time, it will load the Workbook data from Excel and store a snapshot of it. Once a change has been found in Excel meaning that Vectofy and Excel are out of sync, a flag will appear at the top of the window notifying you of this. To update Vectofy to be in sync with the Workbook, simply press the refresh button in the toolbar or use the shortcut `Alt + Shift + r`.
