# Quickstart

If you're new to the software and want a quick few easy steps to get you started, then this quickstart is probably the right place to be.

It will give you an overview of everything you need to get started. There is, of course, more in-depth documentation for all the features if you want to look into something more specific.

Here, we'll be going over:
1. Starting up the software
2. Tracing through dependents and precedents
3. Finding important cells

## Starting up the Software

### Opening Taskpane

To start Vectofy, you're going to want to initially open a document in Excel. To get the most out of this quickstart, choose one with multiple sheets and plenty of formulas connecting different cells. 

Once Excel is open, go to the Home tab and head to the far right. Here, you should see a section title 'Vectofy' and a button labelled 'Start Visualisation'. Click this to open the Vectofy taskpane.

<Info>If you don't see the Vectofy section in the Home tab, make sure that the software is installed correctly. Some help on how to do this can be found in the installation section of these docs.</Info>

Once loading is complete, you will have a 3D visualisation of your current Workbook in the taskpane. Loading is often very quick, but very large or complex workbooks can sometimes take a bit longer. The loading bar should help give you an indication of how much work Vectofy needs to do to open your workbook.

### Moving the Visualisation

To rotate the visualisation, left-click and drag. To move the point of rotation for the visualisation, right-click and drag. 

When using Vectofy, the camera will automatically move to what is improtant in the visualisation as long as autocamera in the Home tab in Vectofy is checked, although you can still use these controls to make adjustments to the camera. Autocamera is checked by default when the software is opened.

### Tracing All Formula Dependencies

Finally, press the 'Trace All Cells' button in the Home tab in Vectofy. This will create lines connecting all precedents and dependent in the workbook on the Vectofy visualisation. 

The lines are a gradient with the colours orange and blue as default. The blue represents precedents in the connection, and the orange represents dependents. This is a quick and easy way to identify the flow of data in the workbook.

Somtimes it's useful to only see a the visualisation produced for a selection of the sheets. By pressing the 'Show Sidebar' button above the bottom menu to the left of the screen, you will be given a list of all sheets in workbook. Simply click one of the sheets in the list to remove it from the visualisation and press it again to remove it.

This selecting and deselecting of sheets can be used with all of Vectofy's features. A sheet distance slider is also present in this sidebar, which controls the distance between each sheet in the visualisation.

## Tracing Through Dependents and Precedents

### Selecting Ranges

Selection works in Vectofy by simply mirroring your currently selected range in Excel. This is shown as a green box surrounding the selected range in the visualisation.

### Freezing Selection

Now head to the 'Discovery' tab in the bottom menu.

When here, you will see a buttom on the left most section of the tab saying 'Freeze Selection'.

By pressing this with a range selected, Vectofy will no longer mirror what is selected in Excel. This allows you to focus on a single selection and explore its related cells within Excel *without it deselecting the selection in Vectofy*. 

To unfreeze a selection, press the button in the same place reading 'Unfreeze Selection'. This will change the selection to whatever is selected in Excel.

### Tracing

With a range selected and frozen, we can now trace its dependents and precedents. 

In the 'Formula Trace' section of the 'Discovery' tab, you will see two sets of buttons at the top labelled 'Precedent' and 'Dependent'. These are use to control tracing.

With a selection frozen, press the left pointing arrow to the left of 'Precedent' to increase your precedent depth. If the selection isn't yet frozen, this will be done automatically upon pressing it. 

<Image src="/assets/quickstart/prec-inc.png" alt="Vectofy add-in with the increment precedent depth highlighted with a red square"/>

All the precedents of your selection will now be highlighted in blue in Vectofy. By pressing the button again, all the precedents of your precedents will be highlighted. This can be continued  until the final precedents to the selection are found. 

<Image src="/assets/quickstart/prec.png" alt="Example of precedent tracing in Vectofy"/>

The current depth of precedents visualised with respect to the selected range is shown by the 'Precedent Depth' counter in 'Formula Trace'.

<Image src="/assets/quickstart/prec-depth.png" alt="Example of precedent depth counter in Vectofy"/>

To decrement the precedent depth, press the single right pointing arrow to the left of 'Precedent', or press the double right pointing arrow directly next to it to reset the depth to 0.

These controls are an identical mirror to those for Dependent tracing, and both can be controlled independently.

<Warning>The software is currently in early release, and tracing to a large depth can sometimes slow down the software.</Warning>

### Reselecting

Sometimes, it can be useful to readjust the selected and frozen range to on which has been highlighted through tracing, *without the need to freeze and unfreeze the selection*. To do this, simply double click on a highlighted cell in tracing, and the selected range will change to that cell and automatically be frozen.

Likewise, it can be handy to directly go to a range highlighted in Vectofy within Excel itself. To do this, single click on the desired highlighted cell. This will select it in Excel but won't affect the selected and frozen range within Vectofy.
