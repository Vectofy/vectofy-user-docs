# Quickstart

If you're new to the software and want a quick few easy steps to get you started, then this quickstart is probably the right place to be.

It will give you an overview of everything you need to get started. There is, of course, more in-depth documentation for all the features if you want to look into something more specific.

Here, we'll be going over:
1. Starting up the software
2. Interacting with Vectofy
3. Tracing through dependents and precedents
4. Finding important cells

## Starting up the Software

### Opening Taskpane

To start Vectofy, you're going to want to initially open a document in Excel. To get the most out of this quickstart, choose one with multiple sheets and plenty of formulas connecting different cells. 

Once Excel is open, go to the Home tab and head to the far right. Here, you should see a section title 'Vectofy' and a button labelled 'Start Visualisation'. Click this to open the Vectofy taskpane.

<Info>If you don't see the Vectofy section in the Home tab, make sure that the software is installed correctly. Some help on how to do this can be found in the installation section of these docs.</Info>

Once loading is complete, you will have a 3D visualisation of your current Workbook in the taskpane. Loading is often very quick, but very large or complex workbooks can sometimes take a bit longer. The loading bar should help give you an indication of how much work Vectofy needs to do to open your workbook.

### Moving the Visualisation

To rotate the visualisation, left-click and drag. To move the point of rotation for the visualisation, right-click and drag. When using Vectofy, the camera will automatically move to what is improtant in the visualisation as long as autocamera in the Home tab in Vectofy is checked, although you can still use these controls to make adjustments to the camera. Autocamera is checked by default when the software is opened.

### Tracing All Formula Dependencies

Finally, press the 'Trace All Cells' button in the Home tab in Vectofy. This will create lines connecting all precedents and dependent in the workbook on the Vectofy visualisation. The lines are a gradient with the colours orange and blue as default. The blue represents precedents in the connection, and the orange represents dependents. This is a quick and easy way to identify the flow of data in the workbook.
